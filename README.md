## Inspiration
Keeping in touch with the people you are close with is something that everyone treasures, however, when you're apart from them it becomes difficult. By creating FriendshipChallenge!, it provides a fun, engaging way to stay connected with your friends and loved ones. 

## What it does
FriendshipChallenge! offers you a new photo prompt every day and allows users to upload and share their photo through a simple extension on their browser. They receive notifications when their friends upload so they can check their photo out!

## How we built it
Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
  
Backend:
- supabase / supabase api

## Challenges we ran into
This was my first time designing a full stack application so figuring out how to connect and handle requests to a storage server was quite difficult. I originally intended to use firebase but was having issues with CORS requests. Switching over to supabase made the integration easier.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I've never built a full stack project before so I'm glad that I was able to create something that works. This was also my first time developing a chrome extension so I was glad that I was able to complete that as well.

## What we learned
I learned how chrome extensions are built from the ground up (and how they actually aren't that hard to make). I also learned more about full stack development, especially how backend works.

## What's next for FriendshipChallenge!
We will add a variety of prompts as well as an archive feature to allow users to look back on past memories
